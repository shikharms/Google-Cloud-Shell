# Cloud Shell Editor gets your first cloud-native app running in minutes

Google Cloud Shell is an online bash shell based on Debian. Cloud Shell is an online development and operations environment accessible anywhere with your browser. You can manage your resources with its online terminal preloaded with utilities such as the gcloud command-line tool, kubectl, and more. You can also develop, build, debug, and deploy your cloud-based apps using the online Cloud Shell Editor.

I have expertise in Cloud engineering across Design, Networking, Application development and deployment, Data Lake, Analytics, BDPaaS, ML, Al, Identity and Access management, Storage, Cluster, LB and contingency options. Along with this, I also developed deep expertise in command line execution with Cloud Shell, YAML, JSON, TensorFlow and many other tools. 

GKE across Design, Networking, Storage, Security, LB and contingency options. At high level I reviewed RBAC for roles and role bindings on cluster resources, securing GKE with Cloud IAM and Pod Security Policies, configuring GKE networking for a cluster to authorized master access and apply network policies to control incoming/outgoing traffic to Pods, and creating services and Ingress resources on K8s and convert the service to use NodePort. Deploying GKE with Helm, running Jobs and CronJobs, validate the solution using kubectl commands, canary deployment to mitigate the risk of new releases, modify GKE clusters, container registry to store and deploy containers and make live changes to the Pod. 

Google Cloud Data engineering across big data, ML, Data Lakes, Data Warehouses, Data Analytics, BDPaaS, Product and Process Analytics, Data Fabric and so on. Also modernizing Data Lakes and Data Warehouses, Building Batch Data Pipelines, Building Resilient Streaming Analytics Systems, Various tools like Airflow, Kubeflow integration with Smart Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI to build cost-effective, scalable and reusable parallel processing platform.

Anthos, GKE, Istio and other Google Cloud Services to create, integrate, or modernize solutions. And further managing and observing microservices-based applications across multiple clusters in GCP, on-premises, or other cloud providers using grafana, prometheus, jaeger, and kiali.

GCP based ML tools for financial markets and trading strategies, using Google Cloud Platform to build basic machine learning models in Jupyter Notebooks and Train a machine learning model to predict and compare models to several benchmarks including AutoML Tables. 

Infrastructure Automation skills building using Google Cloud Deployment manager and Terraform, I deploying infra solutions using Infra as code using Terraform and GCP Deployment Manager, including securely interconnecting networks, load balancing, auto scaling, infrastructure automation and use of various GCP managed services.
